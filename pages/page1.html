   <div class="rdpart"> I wish to confess. I saved you. I saved this city. All your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all. Yes, Father, I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear? I didn't poison the king. Of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of being a dwarf. I've been on trial for that my entire life. I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder, and I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the Gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.</div>
